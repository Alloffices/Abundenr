		<h1 class="text-center">Solar In Florida</h1>
		<h2 class="text-center">Florida Tax Rebates and Incentives</h2>
		<p>Florida is the sunshine state. Only California and Texas have more rooftop solar power potential than Florida, yet Florida doesn’t even rank in the top 10% of installed solar capacity.</p>
		<p>There is no cap for photovoltaic installations under the Florida Energy Policy Act of 2005 effective through 2016. 
        There are tax credits for highly-efficient new homes and commercial buildings and for improvements to existing homes. 
        However, no “renewable portfolio standard” exists for Florida, and the rebate program for solar customers ended in 2015. 
        The State currently offers little or no tax incentives for installing solar, but could change in 2016 with a proposed constitutional amendment to allow third-party financing of solar.</p>
		<p>But this could change in 2016 with a proposed ballot initiative.</p>
		<p>Since the initial investment of a home solar array can be expensive, the bill would provide a financing method whereby solar customers can “pay as they save” instead of having to wait 10 years for a return on their initial investment. 
        The bill is supported by those who believe in less government regulation and proponents of fossil fuel use reduction and those seeking a safer, greener, cleaner planet for future generations.</p>
