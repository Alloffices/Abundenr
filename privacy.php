<p>This <?php echo $file_nm; ?> applies to information collected online from users of the Abundant Energy website. In this policy, you can learn what kind of information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we protect the information, and the choices you have with respect to your personal information.</p>

<p>We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our Web server logs and through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p>Information that you provide to us through a contact form will be used so that we may respond to your inquiry. We may also use information you provide to us to communicate with you in the future. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) at any time.</p>

<p>When you visit our website, we may track information about your visit and store that information in web server logs, which are records of the activities on our sites. The servers automatically capture and save the information electronically. The information logged is not of a personal nature; as examples, we capture your unique Internet Protocol address; the name of your unique Internet Service Provider; the kind of browser or computer you use, and the pages you viewed on our site.</p>

<p>The information we collect in web server logs helps us to administer the site, analyze its usage, provide better, more relevant content to our users, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience.</p>

<p>In order to offer and provide a customized and personal service, our websites and applications may use cookies to store and help track information about you. The use of cookies is relatively standard. However, if you prefer, you can set your browser to either notify you when you receive a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies.</p>

<p>We take certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</p>

<p>We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or other user data to others, and we will not make your personal information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as required by law.</p>

<p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time by using the automatic “opt out” link in our email correspondence to you, or contact us via our phone number, contact form, or mailing address on our website at any time.</p>

<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us via the phone number, contact form, or mailing address listed on this website. If our information practices change in a significant way, we will post the policy changes here.</p>
